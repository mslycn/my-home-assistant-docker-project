2. Add Thread device via ha app on android


3. Add Thread device via ha app on ios


4. Add a shared device

Adding a shared device doesn’t require a Bluetooth dongle or Thread border router.

share code

Matter devices can be added to multiple ecosystems at the same time. If you managed to add it to Google Home, try to share it from Google Home to HA. 

This worked nicely for me with Tuya.

## multi otbr

The code used to pair the device with the Thread Border Router only works with the router after a factory reset.
When the second Thread Border Router must be paired, then a share code from the first Thread Border Router must be extracted.
