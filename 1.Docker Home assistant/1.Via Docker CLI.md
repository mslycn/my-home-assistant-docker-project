To get the Home Assistant up and running on Docker, we make use of the host systemâ€™s CLI by writing some code. Here are the steps to take to get the Home Assistant running on Docker:

Step 1: Write the code to download the latest stable release of Home Assistant container image from github.com.

Step 2: Write the code to install and start the Home Assistant Core Using Docker.(here)

Step 3: Open your Docker  to confirm your Home Assistant container.

Step 4: Open your Home Assistant.

docker pull ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable

This below is my final command that I used on my OS:

~~~
docker run -d --name ha \
--restart=always \
-e TZ=TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
-v /data/homeassistant202405:/config \
-v /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro \
--network=host \
ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable
