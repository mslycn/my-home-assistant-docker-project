This Python project implements a voice assistant that captures the desktop screen, listens for user prompts via speech, and responds with audio output. It leverages OpenAI’s API for speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS), and uses Google Generative AI (gemini-1.5-flash-latest) for natural language processing (NLP) to generate responses based on the user’s voice input and desktop content.
